- 🔭  I’m currently working on redesigning UI layouts for increased accessibility and UX best practices.
  - Developing Dev Tools with the React-Hook-Form library with [formaBull](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/formaBull)
  - Creating tools for improving client management UX for [Good Vibes](https://www.goodvibes.news) (external site)

- 🌱  For my own curiosity, I'm studying ML tools in Python, like TensorFlow and Pandas.

- 👯  I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, especially if it relates to AI.

- 🤔  I’m also interested in other people's eating/workout routines, and balancing those routines with desk life.

- 🧘  I stay loose and focused with sporadic bouts of yoga.

- 🎪  I love circus arts!
  - 🤹  Juggling clubs, 
  - ⚙️  Riding a Unicycle, and
  - 🤸  Flipping around - just not at the same time.
