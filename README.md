# Hi! It's me, Windu. 👋🏼

- I started working for CVS in June of '21 as a fullstack developer.  It's going great!

- 🔭 I spent some time
  - Developing Dev Tools with the React-Hook-Form library with [formaBull](https://github.com/oslabs-beta/formaBull)
  - Creating tools to improve client management for [Good Vibes](https://www.goodvibes.news)

- 🌱  I've been working with Python off and on, though I primarily live in JavaScript land.  I like it - I see more of it in my future.

- 🤔  I’m also interested in other people's eating/workout routines, and balancing those routines with desk life.

- 🧘  I stay loose and focused with sporadic bouts of yoga.

- 🎪  I love circus arts!
  - 🤹  Juggling clubs, 
  - ⚙️  Riding a Unicycle, and
  - 🤸  Flipping around - just not at the same time.
